// Hard Rules in Naming

let 3years = 3; //Cannot start with numbers
let juan&adriana = 'JA'; // Can only contain letters, numbers, underscore or $ sign
// Cannot use reserved keywords of JS
let new = 27;
let function = 'Walk';
let Person = 'John' // The uppercase naming is used for an specific use like OOP
let PI = 3.14 // A name write in all upercase is used to create constants, which are variables that it's value would not change

// A good practice in naming to have cleaner & readable code is to be descriptive
let myFirstJob = 'Librarian';
let myCurrentJob = 'Software Engineer'

// Not a very good practice
let job1 = 'Librarian';
let job2 = 'Software Engineer';
